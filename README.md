# COSE474_DL

In this course, I accomplished 3 assignments about implementing basic deep learning models and learned about various fundamental topics in deep learning.

## Assignment list

Assignment 1 | **MLP Implementation** : Implementing 2-layer neural net with Softmax classfier without Pytorch

Assignment 2 | **CNN Architecture Implementation** : Implementing ResNet-50 and training with CIFAR-10 dataset

Assignment 3 | **Encoder-Decoder Architecture Implementation** : Implementing basic U-Net and U-Net with ResNet-based encoder, and conducting image segmentation with Pascal VOC 2012 dataset
